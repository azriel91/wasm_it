# Introduction

Adding WASM support to an existing native application is unchartered waters for many projects.

This talk covers the conceptual differences between native and WASM application execution, and illustrates the problems encountered and how they were solved.

It does *not* provide exact detail on the code changes that were made. That detail will be provided in a `wasm_rush_report` book that will be released within the next week.

This is also *not* a talk on how WASM works or how to write WASM; Utah Rust published their [WASM introduction videos] which cover this.
